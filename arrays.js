//Arrays are _ordered_, meaning that the elements in them will always appear in the same order. The array [1, 1, 2], is different from the array [1, 2, 1].

//**TODO**: In arrays.js, define a variable called chocolateBars. Its value should be an array of the strings snickers, hundred grand, kitkat, and skittles.


var chocolateBars= [
  "snickers", 
  "hundred grand",
  "kitkat",
  "skittles"
  ];
